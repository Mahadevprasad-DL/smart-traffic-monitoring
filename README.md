# 🚦 Smart Traffic Monitoring

A real-time **Smart Traffic Monitoring System** that visualizes congestion, predicts traffic flow, and analyzes traffic videos for efficient urban mobility.  
Empowering smart cities with **data-driven insights** and **AI-powered decision support**.

---

## 🌆 Project Overview

The **Smart Traffic Monitoring System** is designed to tackle urban traffic challenges using modern web technologies and AI.  
It provides:
- Real-time traffic visualization through interactive dashboards.  
- Heatmaps highlighting congestion-prone areas.  
- Predictive analytics for traffic flow.  
- AI-based video analysis using YOLO for vehicle detection and counting.  

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📊 **Traffic Analytics:** Explore congestion data, speed variations, and vehicle density.  
- 🎥 **Video Analysis:** Upload video footage for real-time vehicle detection using YOLO.  
- 🔮 **Traffic Predictions:** Access predictive models based on historical and live data.  
- 🌡️ **Traffic Heatmap:** Visualize intensity and identify congestion hotspots interactively.  
- ☁️ **Real-Time Integration:** Fetches live data from APIs (TomTom / OpenWeather / etc.).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js  

**Backend:**  
- Flask (Python)  

**APIs:**  
- TomTom API (for live traffic)  
- OpenWeather API (for weather-based analysis)  

**AI & ML:**
